# ImgurStack Chrome Extenson  
### serve imgur.com files in stackoverflow domain through a proxy  
  
This was developed because the imgur.com images are blocked in the workplace web filter. All the images urls are replaced with a  `duckduckgo` proxy url which is prepended to the current url.  
The extension runs in all stackoverflow domains (`*://*.stackoverflow.com/*`).  
   
**Todo**:  
- [ ] Only target imgur image urls
